  <h2>DreamCSV (CSV importer/exporter)</h2>
  <div class="blurb">
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <div class="description">
      This script was made to help DreamHost users import and export
      data from the dreamhost API into csv files, which they can modify offline
      and then re-import.
      <br><br>
      Oh, and the <a href="http://blog.dreamhost.com/2009/04/09/big-boy-time/">DreamHost API contest</a>
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="blurb">
    <h3>Why?</h3>
    <div class="description">
      To be totally honest, I hate CSV, and I hate using spreadsheets. But,
      From time to time, it is the easiest way to communicate with people.
      There are many advantages to using CSV, as many of you know, you can
      load CSV files as tables into Excel. Do you already have lists of email
      addresses in spreadsheets? Business contacts? DNS records? Is someone
      in your organization manually entering this data into dreamhost?
      <br><br>
      In many cases, it may be easier to to all these updates in Excel, and
      sync the updates with DreamHost
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="blurb">
    <h3>How it works</h3>
    <div class="description">
      The CSV importer is a "generic" importer, meaning that you can use it
      with any of the dreamhost API features. There are 2 main modes of
      operation:
      <ul>
        <li>send (imports a CSV file into dreamhost, can delete stuff too!)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. ./dreamcsv --send data.csv --cmd dns-add_record</li>
          <li>e.g. ./dreamcsv --send data.csv --cmd dns-remove_record</li>
          <li>e.g. ./dreamcsv.pl --send list1.csv --cmd announcement_list-add_subscriber --listname list1 --domain joshlange.net</li>
        </ul>
        <li>recieve (exports data from dreamhost into a CSV)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>e.g. ./dreamcsv --receive data.csv --cmd dns-list_records</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      Forgot the name of the command you want to use? Yeah, they are a bit tedius<br>
      to remember.....<br>
      But, thats not a problem! just omit --cmd, and you will be reminded what you have access to.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>./dreamcsv.pl --send list1.csv</li>
      </ul>
      DreamCSV doesn't check to make sure a record doesn't exist before it tries<br>
      to write it. But, this should be ok, because the dreamhost API commands that<br>
      I've tried fail gracefully. What do I mean? well....Try adding a dns record that<br>
      exists. No harm done.<br><br>
      Just make sure you don't delete anything important ;-)

    <h3>Supported Platforms</h3>
    <div class="description">
      Any platform that supports perl. This includes Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <div class="blurb">
    <h3>Getting Started</h3>
    <div class="description">
      The easiest way to get started with DreamCSV is to download it, and run it on the command line.
      <ul>
        <li>Install perl from your operating system's package manager, if you don't already have perl</li>
        <li>IMPORTANT: install Text::CSV_XS (NOT Text::CSV)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Available in Windows' Active Perl package manager</li>
          <li>Available from most linux distro's package managers</li>
          <li>Available from <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~hmbrand/Text-CSV_XS-0.64/CSV_XS.pm">cpan.org</a>, in the unlikely case you have to install it manually</li>
        </ul>
        <li>If you are using windows, install <a href="http://www.activestate.com/activeperl/">ActivePerl</a> for Windows</li>
        <li>If you get a "bad interperter" error, put the correct path to perl on line 1 of the script</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      Oh, and if you are really doing subscription list management, I created a few sample batch files for you.<br><br>
      Once you input the proper values, and put them on a windows desktop, you can send/receive<br>
      <b>email lists</b> from the dreamhost servers by <b>double clicking!</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Great....? For the office administrator, who's in charge of keeping your organization's mailing lists up to date!</li>
      </ul>
